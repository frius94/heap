# heap
Java program to learn how the heap works.
## Usage
You can clone the repository and change the path in the main.java file so the program can create a heap dump file at this path.
## Feature
It creates an ArrayList and creates a dump file. Then it shows the current workload of the heap in the console.

After that it loops a few million times and adds each time an Object to the arrayList.

When the loop has finished, it creates another dump file so you can see the difference in the heap. 

Before the program ends it shows another time the workload of the heap so you can see the difference.
